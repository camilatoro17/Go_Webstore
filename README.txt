I used JavaScript and jQuery for my Ajax implementation. I chose JavaScript when I had to 
get what the user was typing and then find a hint to send back on matches for possible
customers. I would say this was the most enjoyable part of the project because it was satisfying
to see how the queried the db as the user was typing. For jQuery I used it for simplifying the 
form submission with ajax. I didn't have to reload the whole page when I did submit, instead when
a user presses submit it will just update specific elements like the customer table which was nice. 
The most enjoyable part was seeing how ajax functions as something is happening, there's no need
to reload and generally it's just very satisfying to see.
